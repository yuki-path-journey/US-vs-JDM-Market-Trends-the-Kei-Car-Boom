This 1991 Honda Beat is an amazing design, and it has custom interior seat covers that is very professional in craft. The Festival Red (R-80) paint fits the car's personality perfectly and has been well maintained throughout the years. There's no fading or clear coat peel which is very common. The body has been well preserved over the years, free of any notable dents or dings. Very RARE BYS (back yard special) hardtop. The rear window has some small cracks. This vehicle Sports the Mid Engine E07A 656cc 3 cylinder with Factory ITB's and only 67K miles on the engine (in the Honda world that's nothing) and is in amazing shape with no stumbles, leaks, or loss of power. Its small stature makes it ideal around busy cities paired with its incredibly fuel efficient 3 cylinder it makes for a great commuter. However those with access to more open, twisty, roads get to reap the real benefit. Mid engine, RWD, and only 1,675 LBS its natural habitat is being tossed around at its 8,500 rpm redline. Honda's MTREC (Multi Throttle Responsive Engine Control) system makes the power band very linear helping with its drive ability around town. The factory ITBs (individual throttle bodies) scream! which has a great tone and is one of the best experiences you could ask for; especially with the top off. Lowered on RS-R lowering springs and wheel spacers, which complement the car great. All recent maintenance has been preformed and this vehicle is ready for your driveway!Call ☏ 206−774−0043RARE GARAGE AUTO 17150 Tye St SE m, Monroe, WA 98272, United States, Monroe, WA 98272Or use the link belowto view more information!http://www.raregarageauto.comvintage, exotic, classic, muscle car, import car, JDM, RHD, Rare, antique, japanese, european cars.

The VIN is HA4-2319911. This is a very clean example and runs great with no leaks. Suspension feels tight, engine is smooth and strong with smooth shifting through all gears and the timing belt was changed at 90,000km. The exterior is 3.5-4 out of 5 overall with a very clean bed and just a few small rust spots.  All of the lights work, clear headlights, strong parking brake and everything works as intended. All three tailgates fold down or come off to create a flatbed for easy loading. This is the perfect utility truck and is ideal for hauling loads of up to 750 pounds. Actys run on 87 gas, get about 45 mpg and cruise well between 55 and 65 mph. The truck comes with standard silver 12"" steel rims and hubcaps but powder coated color rims are available for an additional cost. Please visit our website to view our full inventory and all available add ons. We have been doing this for years and have brought this truck in legally from Japan. We encourage buyers in the area to swing by the shop to inspect vehicles in person if possible. We also are willing to do FaceTime with customers who are too far to come in person, who would like to see the vehicle before purchasing. We have flexible hours, just contact us to set up a time.  TITLE AND REGISTRATION Our right hand drive collection has been imported under the EPA 25 year exemption. Most states will allow these vehicles to be registered and driven as regular vehicles, but California will not without completing CARB compliance testing first. You can still purchase this vehicle for OHV or private land use without having to complete any CARB testing. If you're a California buyer, please let us know if you have any additional questions on this matter. For buyers outside the state of California, these are street legal and can be driven as a regular vehicle on most roads. We will provide all documentation needed to register and title the vehicle. The documents which will be provided include the Export Certificate/Japanese title as well as the English translation, NHTSA HS-7 Form, EPA Form 3520-1 and CBP Form 7501. We will also send you an invoice and upon full payment, a Bill of Sale.

This 1991 Honda Beat is an amazing design, and it has custom interior seat covers that is very professional in craft. The Festival Red (R-80) paint fits the car's personality perfectly and has been well maintained throughout the years. There's no fading or clear coat peel which is very common. The body has been well preserved over the years, free of any notable dents or dings. Very RARE BYS (back yard special) hardtop. The rear window has some small cracks. This vehicle Sports the Mid Engine E07A 656cc 3 cylinder with Factory ITB's and only 67K miles on the engine (in the Honda world that's nothing) and is in amazing shape with no stumbles, leaks, or loss of power. Its small stature makes it ideal around busy cities paired with its incredibly fuel efficient 3 cylinder it makes for a great commuter. However those with access to more open, twisty, roads get to reap the real benefit. Mid engine, RWD, and only 1,675 LBS its natural habitat is being tossed around at its 8,500 rpm redline. Honda's MTREC (Multi Throttle Responsive Engine Control) system makes the power band very linear helping with its drive ability around town. The factory ITBs (individual throttle bodies) scream! which has a great tone and is one of the best experiences you could ask for; especially with the top off. Lowered on RS-R lowering springs and wheel spacers, which complement the car great.

This 1991 Honda Beat is an amazing design, and it has custom interior seat covers that is very professional in craft. The Festival Red (R-80) paint fits the car's personality perfectly and has been well maintained throughout the years. There's no fading or clear coat peel which is very common. The body has been well preserved over the years, free of any notable dents or dings. Very RARE BYS (back yard special) hardtop. The rear window has some small cracks. This vehicle Sports the Mid Engine E07A 656cc 3 cylinder with Factory ITB's and only 67K miles on the engine (in the Honda world that's nothing) and is in amazing shape with no stumbles, leaks, or loss of power. Its small stature makes it ideal around busy cities paired with its incredibly fuel efficient 3 cylinder it makes for a great commuter. However those with access to more open, twisty, roads get to reap the real benefit. Mid engine, RWD, and only 1,675 LBS its natural habitat is being tossed around at its 8,500 rpm redline. Honda's MTREC (Multi Throttle Responsive Engine Control) system makes the power band very linear helping with its drive ability around town. The factory ITBs (individual throttle bodies) scream! which has a great tone and is one of the best experiences you could ask for; especially with the top off. Lowered on RS-R lowering springs and wheel spacers, which complement the car great. All recent maintenance has been preformed and this vehicle is ready for your driveway!

The Beat was the last car to be approved by Soichiro Honda before he died in 1991. The total number of cars produced was around 33,600. Most of the production (around two-thirds) occurred in the first year, and then production and sales fell drastically. The design of the car originated from Pininfarina, who then sold the design plan to Honda. The Beat was one of many cars designed to take advantage of Japan's tax-efficient kei car class.""",,md,39.035503,-76.902806,2021-04-08T07:55:52-0400

This 1991 Honda Beat is an amazing design, and it has custom interior seat covers that is very professional in craft. The Festival Red (R-80) paint fits the car's personality perfectly and has been well maintained throughout the years. There's no fading or clear coat peel which is very common. The body has been well preserved over the years, free of any notable dents or dings. Very RARE BYS (back yard special) hardtop. The rear window has some small cracks. This vehicle Sports the Mid Engine E07A 656cc 3 cylinder with Factory ITB's and only 67K miles on the engine (in the Honda world that's nothing) and is in amazing shape with no stumbles, leaks, or loss of power. Its small stature makes it ideal around busy cities paired with its incredibly fuel efficient 3 cylinder it makes for a great commuter. However those with access to more open, twisty, roads get to reap the real benefit. Mid engine, RWD, and only 1,675 LBS its natural habitat is being tossed around at its 8,500 rpm redline. Honda's MTREC (Multi Throttle Responsive Engine Control) system makes the power band very linear helping with its drive ability around town. The factory ITBs (individual throttle bodies) scream! which has a great tone and is one of the best experiences you could ask for; especially with the top off. Lowered on RS-R lowering springs and wheel spacers, which complement the car great.

But I have to sell my 1993 Suzuki Carry. My dream mini truck finally became legal, so now that my new truck is on the boat, this one needs to find a new home.   It is a 5 speed manual and has 52k kms (32k miles). Currently inspected and titled. All the hard work is done, you just title and register this and scoot away. It goes 70 mph easily enough. But is happiest at 60 mph on the highway. Has enough torque to take on any Pittsburgh hill.   It needs absolutely nothing. Work done in the last year:  Timing belt/water pump New all season tires Spark plugs Fresh synthetic oil change (doesn't seem to burn oil at all) New oem front struts and rear shocks Front ball joints and axle boots Alignment Added $500 custom tow hitch Added box for storage  This thing is one of a kind. One of the most recognizable trucks in Pittsburgh. I will take off my decals before sale. I do have the original pickup parts that I took off to make the box. Also have a lift kit you could install if you want. Seats are ripped, but good thing seats are for sitting!  The underbody is super clean, no major rust. I always use fluidfilm on my cars twice a year. I would recommend continuing to do that on this guy.   Not super negotiable with price right now. So don't low ball me.

This 1991 Honda Beat is an amazing design, and it has custom interior seat covers that is very professional in craft. The Festival Red (R-80) paint fits the car's personality perfectly and has been well maintained throughout the years. There's no fading or clear coat peel which is very common. The body has been well preserved over the years, free of any notable dents or dings. Very RARE BYS (back yard special) hardtop. The rear window has some small cracks. This vehicle Sports the Mid Engine E07A 656cc 3 cylinder with Factory ITB's and only 67K miles on the engine (in the Honda world that's nothing) and is in amazing shape with no stumbles, leaks, or loss of power. Its small stature makes it ideal around busy cities paired with its incredibly fuel efficient 3 cylinder it makes for a great commuter. However those with access to more open, twisty, roads get to reap the real benefit. Mid engine, RWD, and only 1,675 LBS its natural habitat is being tossed around at its 8,500 rpm redline. Honda's MTREC (Multi Throttle Responsive Engine Control) system makes the power band very linear helping with its drive ability around town. The factory ITBs (individual throttle bodies) scream! which has a great tone and is one of the best experiences you could ask for; especially with the top off. Lowered on RS-R lowering springs and wheel spacers, which complement the car great.

The ninth generation Carry (and third generation Every) appeared in September 1991.The 657 cc F6A engine remained from the previous generation, but an all-new bodywork was much smoother, originally with slim, small rectangular headlights. The chassis was largely unchanged for the truck (albeit with a somewhat longer wheelbase), but the vans had a considerably longer wheelbase and an engine mounted midships, just ahead of the rear axle. Chassis codes changed accordingly, and were now different for the Carry and the Every. The trucks are DC/DD51T and the vans are DE/DF51V (""DD"" and ""DF"" for four-wheel drive versions). Two different front treatments were available, one with small rectangular aerodynamic headlights and one with large, round units (used on lower-spec models).  The ninth-generation Carry received a very gentle facelift in September 1993, which meant that the front drum brakes were switched to discs on all models. Two months later the Carry Van line switched to the Every nameplate and the division between trucks and vans was made clearer yet. Another light change occurred in July 1995, when the front turn signals were changed from clear to amber and the bolt pattern was changed from 114.3 to 100 mm. This generation continued to be built until 1999. Most export markets continued to receive the previous generation Carry, with bigger engines and most commonly with van bodywork. The older Super Carry is generally more rugged than the DE/DF51, which was fitted with a coil sprung De Dion rear axle not as suitable for carrying heavy loads. In those rather few foreign markets where the ninth-generation Carry was available, it was sold as the SK306 and with a version of the 657 cc engine used in the Japanese Domestic Market. In late 1997, the retro-styled Suzuki Every C arrived.",,sc,34.8533,-82.4493,2021-04-29T13:42:14-0400

This car is defiantly a head turner so be prepared for people to ask for pictures! The car is in perfect mechanical condition with no leaks of any kind. The car has had its fluids changed and is up to date on all services including four new tires. It has been stored indoors its entire life meaning there is no rust what so ever on the car. The Pao is a right hand drive JDM(Japanese Domestic Market) vehicle imported straight from Yokohama Japan. Contrary to most Pao's, this car has working heat and A/C partnered with the flawless original stereo system. The interior is just as breathtaking as the exterior as there are no rips, stains or smudges anywhere in the cabin. The car has been outfitted with power steering and a modern braking system. The Pao also has great gas milage at 51 mpg in the city and 79 mpg on the highway! The baby blue exterior matches the interior dash and door panels and the paint of the vehicle is absolutely mint. The car is registered with the DMV and is just as easy to register as any other car.   Please feel free to contact me at any time if you want to give the car a test drive!",,va,37.5109,-77.6429,2021-04-24T12:40:41-0400
